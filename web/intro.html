    <title>B. Heder's Introduction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>My name is Bryan Heder, and I'm currently a full-time student at BYU-Idaho. 
        I have a wonderful wife, Lydia, and a toddler son, Isaac. We will also have a daughter born 
        to us in April.

    <p>When I have some free time to myself, I like to do some roleplaying-by-post, which is basically 
        writing a story together with other people by controlling certain characters within the story.
